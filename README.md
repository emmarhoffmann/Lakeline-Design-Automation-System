# Lakeline-Design-Automation-System

The Lakeline Design Automation System is a comprehensive set of tools developed for automating key aspects of product management and image processing for Lakeline Design, a creative venture founded by Emma Hoffmann that features lake-inspired artwork. This project, created collaboratively by Emma Hoffmann and Blake Norman, includes:

**Folder_Generator.py**: Organizes lake print designs into structured folders, setting up the necessary directory structure for further processing.

**Etsy_Image_Generator.py**: Generates mockup images for Etsy products, overlaying lake print designs onto various mockup backgrounds.

**Shopify_Image_Generator.py**: Generates mockup images for Shopify products, overlaying lake print designs onto various mockup backgrounds customized for different print design and frame product variations.

**Shopify_Product_Generator.py**: Automates the creation of new products on Shopify, including duplicating a base product, customizing product details, and uploading images with alt texts for connecting images to product variants.

**Script_Manager.py**: Manages the execution of individual or all scripts for standard usage, ensuring a smooth and error-checked workflow.

**etsy_config_portrait.json**, **etsy_config_landscape.json**, **shopify_config_portrait.json**, **shopify_config_landscape.json**: Configuration files for prints, including the base and output paths as well as coordinates for the placement of prints over the base images.

**completed_lakes.txt**: List of completed lakes for new lake product checking.

This system virtually elimites manual work through its automated processes, ensuring consistent, high-quality output across Etsy and Shopify platforms for Lakeline Design products.
